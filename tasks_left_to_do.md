- Clear screen before each menu (use os.system('cls')) 
- test_Member.py functions (Assinged to MG)
- Summary report (Assigned to AM and PS and MG)
- have to do update member records function --- finished with update name .... still need to do update addresW
- Need to deal with remove provider as well. we can't remove the provider immediately. we have to wait till 1 week to ensure that they get paid?
When prompting to remove provider, ask if the provider is eligible to be removed (they have been payed, and they have been inactive)
