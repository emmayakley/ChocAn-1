- Clear screen before each menu (use os.system('cls')) 

- Update tests with the provider status added in
- Remove provider should have two versions, one to mark to be removed
    and the other to actually remove. Need to keep for at least one 
    week for reporting/paying
    -Update status function for provider. Call this from the menu
    -Call remove provider somewhere else. Maybe a weekly purge? depending on dates?
